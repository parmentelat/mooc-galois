Hello, welcome to this presentation of the MOOC "Introduction to Galois Theory"

2
00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:14.010
MOOC, or FLOT, for "Formation en Ligne Ouverte a Tous", in Moliere's language

3
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:21.520
 Solving polynomial equations with a degree <= 4 has been achievable by mathematicians since XVI-th century

4
00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:27.030
For example in this second degree equation, we have  

5
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:38.540
a root : [ 1/2 + 1/2 j sqrt(3) ] that is a typical standard resolution based on the discriminant (here -3)

6
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.550
In this 3rd-degree example, 

7
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:57.560
here the real root only involves cubic and square root operations, as well as, of course, the 4 arithmetic operations

8
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.570
let us look at a very simple degree-4 equation

9
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.080
 we will use a free software named sage, that I recommend to use

10
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:9.090
that turned out extremely efficient

11
00:01:9.100 --> 00:01:13.100
so what do we find ?

12
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.110
well, depending on the taste, a beautiful or ugly formula

13
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:24.620
that involves the 4 operations, nested n-th roots 

14
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.630
here cubic and square roots

15
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.140
we will see as an exercise that these equations with a degree <= 4 can be solved

16
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.650
you will be taught how to, the way mathematicians know how to do that for a very long time

17
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.160
so what happens with degrees >= 5 ?

18
00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.670
for that let us consider 3 typical examples

19
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:58.680
first example is very simple, low degree, simple coefficients

20
00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:06.690
second example, still low degree, but more complex coefs

21
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:18.200
finally third example, really complicated with a high degree (9), and many non-null coefs

22
00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.210
What questions can we ask ourselves ?

23
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:30.220
are we able to solve these equations using only the 4 operations, and nested roots

24
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:37.730
and if so, which is the simplest to solve, which is the hardest

25
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:45.740
like earlier, we use sage, some good publicity for this very nice software

26
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.250
let us see

27
00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.260
you can see here the 3 equations in question

28
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:59.270
for the most complicated one, there is a cubic root here

29
00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.280
and here a power of a cubic root, and a square root

30
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.290
so we have a solution with nested radicals

31
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:25.300
the second equation, a little simpler, and here again we have a solution that involves only  square roots

32
00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.310
so here again solutions can be expressed as nested radicals

33
00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:39.820
for the last one, apparently the simplest, sage does not know how to handle it, that's why it just copies the input equation

34
00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.330
simply because there is no such formula, like Galois's theory will explain

35
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:50.340
so we can see that the simplest of these 3 equations

36
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:55.350
is not solvable with nested radicals

37
00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:04.860
while more complex equations are solvable this way, including the one with a high degree and complex coefs

38
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:9.870
the order of complexity of these equations is unexpected

39
00:04:9.880 --> 00:04:14.880
since it is (2) < (3) < (1) which is counter-intuitive

40
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.890
so Galois's theory can explain what is happening here, and you will be taught how to define Galois groups

41
00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.400
how to compute them, and how to understand all these phenomena

42
00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.910
So let us explain, what is intuitively this Galois group ? 

43
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:36.920
the key concept is the notion of symetry, symetry within C the field of complex numbers,  that preserves the 4 operations

44
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:43.430
these symetries shuffle the roots of any polynomial equation

45
00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.440
so this is a set of permutations of these n roots

46
00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.450
and these permutations make the Galois group of this equation

47
00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:58.460
to get an intuitive grasp on this notion, let us have a little quizz

48
00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.970
on a very concrete example

49
00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.980
let us look at the first, apparently simplest, equation

50
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:13.990
using a calculus software, or using our future skills

51
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000
this group is generated by two elements

52
00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:27.510
two permutations of the 5 roots z1..z5

53
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.520
(1) a cyclic permutation among the 5 roots 

54
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:39.030
(2) a transposition that swaps z1 and z2

55
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:45.540
we will see how to compute the group generated by (1) and (2)

56
00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:52.050
and will see this is the set of all permutations, it has 120 elements, and somehow rather complex 

57
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:57.060
The second equation has a Galois group generated by a single element

58
00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:04.070
a cyclic permutation of 4 of the 5 roots, one of the roots is a singularity, we call it z5

59
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:9.080
this is simply because there is an "obvious" root, namely -1

60
00:06:9.090 --> 00:06:15.090
which is a rational number, and these are always fixed by the Galois group

61
00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:21.100
this is why we only have 4 of the 5 roots involved in the permutations; this is a very simple group

62
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:31.110
as for the last and third equation, we again have a group generated by a single cyclic permutation of the 9 roots

63
00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:40.620
So let us summarize; the Galois group for equation (2), low degree but complex coefs,

64
00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:45.630
is a commutative, cyclic group,  with a very small cardinal (4)

65
00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:53.640
Equation (3), apparently the hardest, high degree, many coefs,

66
00:06:53.650 --> 00:07:02.150
gives a commutative, cyclic, very simple group, with a slightly larger cardinal (9), so a bit more complex than G2

67
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:14.160
and equation (1), apparently the simplest, gives a group that is not commutative,

68
00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:19.670
very large (cardinal 120), and we will see that it is non-solvable in the sense of the group theory

69
00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:24.680
hence the counter-intuitive order of complexity among the equations (2) < (3) < (1)

70
00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:29.690
